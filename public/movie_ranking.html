<h1>The Best Movies According to Prakhar</h1>
<h2>My top 4 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>PK</h3>
<p>
  The movie, a complete package, not only tickles your funny bone but also gives
  you a new perspective toward life and religions
</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>
  Although, the complete Batman Trilogy from Nolan is amazing, but this one is
  exceptional. The story, the direction, the action, the dialogues everything is
  just perfect.
</p>
<h3>The Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  Another masterpiece by Nolan, this movie makes us realize what the true potential of the sci-fi
  genre is. Nolan visualized a black hole for this movie even before we had an
  actual picture and his visualization is very similar to the actual image. All
  hail Nolan's genius.
